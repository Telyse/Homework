      <h3> My time so far at Savvy Coders</h3>
      <p> I am a 22 year old aspiring software engineer, who loves to challenge herself and learn new
        things. Currently I go to at an online school named Savvy Coders to learn how to code and
        program. So far I've learned the basics of Javascript, as well as Hyper Text Markup Language
        (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). After spending some time learning and practicing how to
        code, I've realized that I can see myself headings towards my dream career path of
        becoming a software engineer.
