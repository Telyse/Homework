    <p> I am a 22 year old aspiring software engineer, who loves to challenge herself and learn new
    things. Currently I go to at an online school named Savvy Coders to learn how to code and
    program. So far I've learned the basics of Javascript, as well as Hyper Text Markup Language
    (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). After spending some time learning and practicing how to
    code, I've realized that I can see myself headings towards my dream career path of
    becoming a software engineer.
